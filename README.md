# Motion Detector Based Sond N Brightness Contoller

This is a NetBeans project that contains code written in JAVA and OpenCV libraries to the detect motion of a closed hand as shown in the image.

**Move your hand upwards to increase the volume, downwards to decrease it, left to right to increase the brightness and right to left to decrease it!**

For now this code works only on Linux because it uses linux specific commands to set the conrols.
